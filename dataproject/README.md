# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **Volatility in Stock Market Indices** and contains a descriptive analysis of three stock market indices with respect to the dot-com bubble, the global financial crisis and the recent corona crisis. We fetch the data using APIs.

The results of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install pydst``
``pip install quandl``
