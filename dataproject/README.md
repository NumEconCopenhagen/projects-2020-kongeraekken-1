# Data analysis project

In our project, which is titled **VOLATILITY IN STOCK MARKET INDICES**, we use APIs to fetch daily data for the Nasdaq Composite, Nikkei 225 and OMX C20 indices and use them to perform a descriptive analysis of stock market volatility from 2000 to today.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``
``pip install pydst``
``pip install quandl``
