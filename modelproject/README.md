# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Dynamic Optimization With and Without Income Risk** and is about exploring consumer behaviour under different levels of risk aversion and for different risk scenarios.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
